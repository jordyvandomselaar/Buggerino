# Buggerino

## What is it? üì±Ô∏è

Buggerino is a native app for Android/IOS that allows you to interact with your Bugsnag.

## What's Bugsnag? üêõÔ∏è

> Bugsnag is an error-monitoring tool that allows your developers to identify, prioritize and replicate bugs in a time-efficient and enjoyable manner. Bugsnag creates an ownership mentality with all developers by enabling them to proactively see the effects of their code. This helps them address issues before these escalate, creating a joyful experience for both customers and engineers. ~ Bugsnag

## But, why?

Personally I'm not really a fan of the web client on mobile devices, it works but it doesn't really spark joy. I set out to create a native app that uses their fantastic API to learn more about React native, Expo and their respective ecosystems.

## The stack üí∏Ô∏è

1. React native
2. Expo
3. Redux
4. Redux-saga
5. Styled-components
